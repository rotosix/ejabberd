@title pooler - An OTP Process Pool Application
@doc 
The pooler application allows you to manage pools of OTP behaviors
such as gen_servers, gen_fsms, or supervisors, and provide consumers
with exclusive access to pool members using pooler:take_member.

See the README.org file for a good introduction to what pooler is all
about.
